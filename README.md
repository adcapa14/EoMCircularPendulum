This script calculates the motion of a pendulum which anchor point is moving in the x-axis. There is just 1 case implemented:

1) The angular velocity ($\dot{\phi}$) has a linear behavior in time.

By executing it, you'll have 4 plots. The plots show the evolution in time of:
1) The angle \theta, the pendullum angle.
2) Angular velocity, defined as $\dot{\theta}$.
3) (Potential, Kinetic and Yotal) energy.
4) The motion of the pendulum in the xy-plane.

This is an output of the script:
